# React Router Project

This project is built with React and React Router, where I explored React Router and its features. Throughout development, I learned about dynamic routing, nested routes, protected routes, and more.

## Tech Stack

- React
- React Router

## Features

- **URL Params Layout**: Learned how to strucute dynamic routes using URL parameters Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Query Strings**: Learned query strings to filter and fetch data dynamically.
- **Customizing Links**: Explored how to enhance navigation by customizing `<Link>` component with additional styles.
- **Nested Routes**: Learned nested routes ensuring a structured and maintainable routing hierarchy.
- **Rerouting using Navigate**: Used the Navigate component for navigation, such as redirecting on invalid page.
- **React Lazy**: Optimized performance by implementing React.lazy for code-splitting and dynamically loading components only when needed.
- **Route Configs**: Configured routes using useRoutes centrally to improve maintainability, making it easier to manage navigation across the application.
- **Protected Routes**: Learned protected routes to restrict access to certain pages based on authentication and user roles.
- **404 Pages**: Designed a custom 404 page to improve user experience when navigating to non-existent routes.
- **Passing Props to Link**: Learned how to pass props through the <Link> component to dynamically modify behavior and ensure smooth state management between pages.
